The Decentralized Pharma Supply Chain Dashboard is a lightweight web-based application designed to simulate the core functionality of a medicine management system in a pharmaceutical supply chain. The system allows users to add and search for medicines while tracking crucial information such as:

1)Medicine Name
2)Manufacturing Date
3)Expiry Date
4)Price

Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, the application provides a user-friendly interface to store and retrieve medicine data locally, mimicking the operations of a decentralized supply chain.
